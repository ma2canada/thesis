%% SUMMARY OF FEATURES:
%%
%% All environments, commands, and options provided by the `ut-thesis'
%% class will be described below, at the point where they should appear
%% in the document.  See the file `ut-thesis.cls' for more details.
%%
%% To explicitly set the pagestyle of any blank page inserted with
%% \cleardoublepage, use one of \clearemptydoublepage,
%% \clearplaindoublepage, \clearthesisdoublepage, or
%% \clearstandarddoublepage (to use the style currently in effect).
%%
%% For single-spaced quotes or quotations, use the `longquote' and
%% `longquotation' environments.


%%%%%%%%%%%%         PREAMBLE         %%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  - Default settings format a final copy (single-sided, normal
%%    margins, one-and-a-half-spaced with single-spaced notes).
%%  - For a rough copy (double-sided, normal margins, double-spaced,
%%    with the word "DRAFT" printed at each corner of every page), use
%%    the `draft' option.
%%  - The default global line spacing can be changed with one of the
%%    options `singlespaced', `onehalfspaced', or `doublespaced'.
%%  - Footnotes and marginal notes are all single-spaced by default, but
%%    can be made to have the same spacing as the rest of the document
%%    by using the option `standardspacednotes'.
%%  - The size of the margins can be changed with one of the options:
%%     . `narrowmargins' (1 1/4" left, 3/4" others),
%%     . `normalmargins' (1 1/4" left, 1" others),
%%     . `widemargins' (1 1/4" all),
%%     . `extrawidemargins' (1 1/2" all).
%%  - The pagestyle of "cleared" pages (empty pages inserted in
%%    two-sided documents to put the next page on the right-hand side)
%%    can be set with one of the options `cleardoublepagestyleempty',
%%    `cleardoublepagestyleplain', or `cleardoublepagestylestandard'.
%%  - Any other standard option for the `report' document class can be
%%    used to override the default or draft settings (such as `10pt',
%%    `11pt', `12pt'), and standard LaTeX packages can be used to
%%    further customize the layout and/or formatting of the document.

%% The standard packages `geometry' and `setspace' are already loaded by
%% `ut-thesis' -- see their documentation for details of the features
%% they provide.  In particular, you may use the \geometry command here
%% to adjust the margins if none of the ut-thesis options are suitable
%% (see the `geometry' package for details).  You may also use the
%% \setstretch command to set the line spacing to a value other than
%% single, one-and-a-half, or double spaced (see the `setspace' package
%% for details).

%%%%%%%%%%%%      MAIN  DOCUMENT      %%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{document}

%% This sets the page style and numbering for preliminary sections.
\begin{preliminary}

%% This generates the title page from the information given above.
\maketitle

%% There should be NOTHING between the title page and abstract.
%% However, if your document is two-sided and you want the abstract
%% _not_ to appear on the back of the title page, then uncomment the
%% following line.
%\cleardoublepage

%% This generates the abstract page, with the line spacing adjusted
%% according to SGS guidelines.
\begin{abstract}
%% *** Put your Abstract here. ***

%NTS:::391 words rather than 350
This thesis is concerned with demographic stochastics. That is, the randomness inherent in systems with a discrete state space. 
In biology this arises naturally in ecological systems. 
%The number of living bacteria in a droplet of water can be forty two or forty three, but it cannot be forty two and a half; that half bacterium would more aptly be considered `dying' than `living'. 
%"strategic lit review"
%"gap"
%"thesis" "in this paper I will..."
%"roadmap"
%"short significance"
Stochastics, as applied in the biological context, was first done by Kimura when calculating the dynamics of gene frequencies in a population. %something re ecological context... Wright Fisher, Moran, the other big names, etc
Kimura, and most theoretical ecologists since, employed the Fokker-Planck equation, a partial differential equations method which further approximates the system by assuming continuous population sizes %cf. discrete state space
In the context of population ecology, the similar Moran model of two species is the cleanest example of two competing species in an ecosystem, with eventually one going extinct and one fixating after some short characteristic time dependent on the system size. 
However, this model assumes the two species are identical, and that they compete with each other (interspecies) as strongly as they compete with themselves (intraspecies). 
Some recent researchers have addressed this by noticing that results similar to that of Moran are found in one limit of the famous generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with stochastic fluctuations. 
They employ various approximate techniques, usually the Fokker-Planck equation, and explore various metrics of this noisy Lotka-Volterra model, which in other limits has a long average extinction time. 
None, however, have looked at how the system transitions between its slow and fast limits. 
Most have also restricted themselves to uncontrolled approximations
This is where I situate my research. 
In this thesis I will show that competing species can coexist unless their ecological niches entirely overlap, and that this niche overlap anticorrelates with a species' ability to invade an established ecosystem. 
To accomplish this I shall first perform a thorough investigation of the various approximation techniques commonly used in stochastic biophysical modelling on a one dimensional Lotka-Volterra toy model. 
Thence I will investigate the two dimensional version, in particular to characterize the transition between its regular slow dynamics and the fast times limit corresponding to the foundational Moran model. 
I do this with an arbitrarily accurate technique for calculating mean fixation times. 
Finally, by regarding the opposite process to fixation, I can comment on the stability of the 2D model with regards to invasion attempts. 
The obvious consequence of my research is a better null hypothesis for the dynamics of small homogeneous communities like the human microbiomes. 
More generally the results are of significance in estimations of timescale for paleontology and phylogeny.

%% Anything placed between the abstract and table of contents will
%% appear on a separate page since the abstract ends with \newpage and
%% the table of contents starts with \clearpage.  Use \cleardoublepage
%% for anything that you want to appear on a right-hand page.

%% This generates a "dedication" section, if needed -- just a paragraph
%% formatted flush right (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{dedication}
%% *** Put your Dedication here. ***
%\end{dedication}

%% The `dedication' and `acknowledgements' sections do not create new
%% pages so if you want the two sections to appear on separate pages,
%% uncomment the following line.
%\newpage  % separate pages for dedication and acknowledgements

%% Alternatively, if you leave both on the same page, it is probably a
%% good idea to add a bit of extra vertical space in between the two --
%% for example, as follows (adjust as desired).
%\vspace{.5in}  % vertical space between dedication and acknowledgements

%% This generates an "acknowledgements" section, if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\begin{acknowledgements}
%% *** Put your Acknowledgements here. ***
%\end{acknowledgements}

%% This generates the Table of Contents (on a separate page).
\tableofcontents

%% This generates the List of Tables (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoftables

%% This generates the List of Figures (on a separate page), if needed
%% (uncomment to have it appear in the document).
%\listoffigures

%% You can add commands here to generate any other material that belongs
%% in the head matter (for example, List of Plates, Index of Symbols, or
%% List of Appendices).

%% End of the preliminary sections: reset page style and numbering.
\end{preliminary}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%  Put your Chapters here; the easiest way to do this is to keep     %%
%%  each chapter in a separate file and `\include' all the files.     %%
%%  Each chapter file should start with "\chapter{ChapterName}".      %%
%%  Note that using `\include' instead of `\input' will make each     %%
%%  chapter start on a new page, and allow you to format only parts   %%
%%  of your thesis at a time by using `\includeonly'.                 %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% *** Include chapter files here. ***
\include{Ch0-ConIsKi}
\include{Ch1-TheLoneliestNumber}
\include{Ch2-TheIncredibleBulk}
\include{Ch3-ImmigrantSong}
%\include{Ch4-should be part of the previous chapter probably}
\include{Ch4-UltimateShowdown}


%% This adds a line for the Bibliography in the Table of Contents.
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
%% *** Set the bibliography style. ***
%% (change according to your preference/requirements)
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
%% *** Set the bibliography file. ***
%% ("thesis.bib" by default; change as needed)
%\bibliography{paper1-6final}
%\bibliography{thesis}
\bibliography{library}

%% *** NOTE ***
%% If you don't use bibliography files, comment out the previous line
%% and use \begin{thebibliography}...\end{thebibliography}.  (In that
%% case, you should probably put the bibliography in a separate file and
%% `\include' or `\input' it here).
